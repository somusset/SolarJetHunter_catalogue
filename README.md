# SolarJetHunter_catalogue
Contains tutorial and examples on how to find, open and read the jet catalogue produced from the Solar Jet Hunter Zooniverse project: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/sophiemu/solar-jet-hunter. These tutorial and examples are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

## The catalogue
The first version of the Solar Jet Hunter catalogue is publicly available here is two formats: JSON and CSV. One of these files need to be downloaded before proceeding to the analysis. Both files contain the same jet catalogue, but the JSON file contains more information on the intermediate analysis that happen as we aggregated the results of the annotations performed by the volunteers of Solar Jet Hunter.

A paper describing how the project was run and the catalogue was constructed is available here.

To use the notebooks presented here, please download the catalogue(s) in the `\export` directory.
